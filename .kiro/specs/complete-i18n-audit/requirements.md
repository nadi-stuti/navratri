# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures comprehensive internationalization (i18n) coverage across the entire Navratri app for all 8 supported languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Kannada). The goal is to eliminate all hardcoded strings and ensure every user-facing text element is properly translated and accessible through the i18n system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who speaks any of the 8 supported languages, I want all text content in the app to be displayed in my selected language, so that I can fully understand and navigate the application without language barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects any of the 8 supported languages THEN all visible text content SHALL be displayed in that language
2. WHEN the app loads THEN no hardcoded English or other language strings SHALL be visible in the UI
3. WHEN navigating through all pages and components THEN every text element SHALL use the translation system
4. IF a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL display a fallback value that indicates the missing translation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the app, I want a systematic audit process to identify and fix untranslated content, so that I can ensure complete i18n coverage and maintain translation quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a code audit THEN all hardcoded strings in JSX elements SHALL be identified and catalogued
2. WHEN reviewing translation files THEN missing translation keys SHALL be identified across all 8 language files
3. WHEN adding new features THEN a process SHALL exist to ensure new strings are immediately added to all translation files
4. WHEN translation keys are inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide clear error reporting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user accessing the app, I want all interactive elements (buttons, labels, placeholders, alt text) to be properly translated, so that I can understand the purpose and function of every UI element.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with buttons THEN all button text SHALL be translated
2. WHEN viewing form elements THEN all labels, placeholders, and validation messages SHALL be translated
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all aria-labels and alt text SHALL be translated
4. WHEN encountering error messages THEN all error text SHALL be translated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want all static content (page descriptions, festival information, recipe details) to be properly structured in translation files, so that content can be easily updated and maintained across all languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing festival information pages THEN all content SHALL be loaded from translation files
2. WHEN browsing recipe data THEN recipe names, descriptions, and instructions SHALL support multilingual content
3. WHEN reading cultural content THEN all traditional information SHALL be available in appropriate regional languages
4. WHEN content is updated THEN changes SHALL be reflected across all supported languages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all accessibility features to work correctly in my preferred language, so that I can use assistive technologies effectively with translated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN all aria-labels SHALL be properly translated
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN all focus indicators and announcements SHALL be in the selected language
3. WHEN encountering loading states THEN all loading messages SHALL be translated
4. WHEN errors occur THEN all error announcements SHALL be accessible in the user's language

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want validation tools to ensure translation completeness and consistency, so that I can verify all languages have complete and accurate translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running validation scripts THEN missing translation keys SHALL be reported for each language
2. WHEN comparing translation files THEN structural inconsistencies SHALL be identified
3. WHEN testing language switching THEN all content SHALL update immediately without requiring page refresh
4. WHEN validating translations THEN placeholder values and untranslated content SHALL be flagged
